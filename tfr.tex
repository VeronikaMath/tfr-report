% \section{Notes/To Do}
% Things to write:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Background: introduce application to radiotherapy treatment planning and equations describing radiation transport. Introduce the simplified model (like reading course model) that we will focus on here. Maybe also full Boltzman equation?
%     \item Explain how the choice of norm for the minimisation problem can lead to nonlinear PDEs - this motivates use of the full FBSDE framework (because we get nonlinear source terms)
%     \item Explain why the full coupled system can't be fit into the FBSDE framework - the forward/primal equation is not of the form in the FBSDE system (even with constant coefficients, because of time reversal?)
%     \item Details of how $z$ gets its BCs and TC from those we have for $u$
%     \item Convergence of approximation (twofold x 2): Does the iterative scheme converge when soln's to the sequence of PDEs are exact? I.e. $u^{(k)} \rightarrow u^{(*)}$? And is $u^{(*)}$ the right thing? Furthermore, does the iterative scheme converge (and to the right thing) when the soln's to the sequence of PDEs are approximated numerical sol'ns?
%     \item Results of numerical experiments
%     \item Future extensions of this model/framework: Model for radiation in multiple spatial dimensions (now just 1D), better/more accurate discretisation schemes e.g. SSP, MLMC, higher order in general?
%     \item another future work thing: figure out how to parallelize the MC code?
%     \item Motivation for the SSP methods for FBSDE: iterating through numerically solving each PDE in sequence, we want to make sure error is not propagated / does not grow? (Also motivation for FBSDE framework is to deal with the nonlinearity that arises when a different norm is chosen for the optimisation problem)
%     \item Write about how BCs on the dual ($z$) are implemented in the Monte Carlo simulations + FC for boundary value problems (integration bound = stopping time, i.e. random!)
% \end{itemize}

% NB: Need more references: 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Ref for the PDE constrained optimisation problem (and the iterative scheme for $(u^{(k)},z^{(k)})$) needed
%     \item Reuse refs from reading course report 
%     \item Some ref for physics-y bits? Or medical bits?
%     \item We have a few refs for Monte Carlo stuff e.g. Gobet, Oksendal, Klebaner
%     \item Also the SSP FBSDE paper (already in refs here)
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Spare Theory}

% - PDE Constrained optimisation problem 

% - Forward + Backward PDEs

% - Initial/terminal conditions, boundary conditions, and source terms (figure out equivalent formulations?)

% \vspace{5mm}
% - Forward + Backward SDEs

% - Connections between FBSDEs and the PDEs (eg distribution of process given by forward SDE is described by sol to Fokker-Planck/Kolmogorov forward eqn)

% - Feynman-Kac formulae (of various kinds)

% - Solving Fokker-Planck using MC + Feynman-Kac (as in reading course)

% - Simplest scheme for Forward-Backward SDEs

% - New (\cite{fang2023strong}) SSP scheme for FBSDEs

% - Specifically what schemes and equations look like for the reading course model

% - Similarities/Differences between the "first" (linear?) kind of Feynman-Kac formula, and the FBSDE *nonlinear* Feynman-Kac formulae?

% - CONSISTENT NOTATION --- there is something weird with functions $f$ and $g$ at the moment, for example\dots

% 1. I think you should add a little more info on the physical background and include relevent references, Bortfeld for example.
% 2. How do you get to equation 1? It’s a jump to start there. More detail before.
% 3. I think there’s a typo in eqn 1
% 4. I think you could mention different a’s come from different energy models, Bragg Kleeman, for example.
% 5. Eqn 4 doesn’t specify norms, then if you do, norms aren’t defined until lower. Perhaps just write _X or something
% 6. Same with 15
% 7. Why might you choose different p values in 24? Also, does it make sense to have the ‘error bit’ in the same norm as the ‘regularisation bit’?
% 8. Isn’t assumption 1 asking b and sigma are Lipschitz continuous in y and continuous in t?
% 9. Assumption 2 and 4 corresponds to an asymptotic growth condition? Can you comment on why it’s needed?
% 10. Assumption 3 is quite strict, is there a weaker variant discussed in some reference?
% 11. I think you can make 52 clearer if you write for x\in \Omega and t \in [0,T] after the equations and slap the ICs together with the PDEs
% 12. You need to mention something about convergence of the iterative scheme, reference the Kelley book
% 13. above 58 approcimate, run a spell checker
% 14. You should include the truncation errors in 58-62 or mention them somewhere and reference
% 15. what motivates the semi implicit temporal discretisation 63?
% 16. does 76 not just mean 0 < 1? Is the scheme unconditionally stable?


% \section{Notes/To Do}
% Things to write:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Background: introduce application to radiotherapy treatment planning and equations describing radiation transport. Introduce the simplified model (like reading course model) that we will focus on here. Maybe also full Boltzman equation?
%     \item Explain how the choice of norm for the minimisation problem can lead to nonlinear PDEs - this motivates use of the full FBSDE framework (because we get nonlinear source terms)
%     \item Explain why the full coupled system can't be fit into the FBSDE framework - the forward/primal equation is not of the form in the FBSDE system (even with constant coefficients, because of time reversal?)
%     \item Details of how $z$ gets its BCs and TC from those we have for $u$
%     \item Convergence of approximation (twofold x 2): Does the iterative scheme converge when soln's to the sequence of PDEs are exact? I.e. $u^{(k)} \rightarrow u^{(*)}$? And is $u^{(*)}$ the right thing? Furthermore, does the iterative scheme converge (and to the right thing) when the soln's to the sequence of PDEs are approximated numerical sol'ns?
%     \item Results of numerical experiments
%     \item Future extensions of this model/framework: Model for radiation in multiple spatial dimensions (now just 1D), better/more accurate discretisation schemes e.g. SSP, MLMC, higher order in general?
%     \item another future work thing: figure out how to parallelize the MC code?
%     \item Motivation for the SSP methods for FBSDE: iterating through numerically solving each PDE in sequence, we want to make sure error is not propagated / does not grow? (Also motivation for FBSDE framework is to deal with the nonlinearity that arises when a different norm is chosen for the optimisation problem)
%     \item Write about how BCs on the dual ($z$) are implemented in the Monte Carlo simulations + FC for boundary value problems (integration bound = stopping time, i.e. random!)
% \end{itemize}

% NB: Need more references: 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Ref for the PDE constrained optimisation problem (and the iterative scheme for $(u^{(k)},z^{(k)})$) needed
%     \item Reuse refs from reading course report 
%     \item Some ref for physics-y bits? Or medical bits?
%     \item We have a few refs for Monte Carlo stuff e.g. Gobet, Oksendal, Klebaner
%     \item Also the SSP FBSDE paper (already in refs here)
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Spare Theory}

% - PDE Constrained optimisation problem 

% - Forward + Backward PDEs

% - Initial/terminal conditions, boundary conditions, and source terms (figure out equivalent formulations?)

% \vspace{5mm}
% - Forward + Backward SDEs

% - Connections between FBSDEs and the PDEs (eg distribution of process given by forward SDE is described by sol to Fokker-Planck/Kolmogorov forward eqn)

% - Feynman-Kac formulae (of various kinds)

% - Solving Fokker-Planck using MC + Feynman-Kac (as in reading course)

% - Simplest scheme for Forward-Backward SDEs

% - New (\cite{fang2023strong}) SSP scheme for FBSDEs

% - Specifically what schemes and equations look like for the reading course model

% - Similarities/Differences between the "first" (linear?) kind of Feynman-Kac formula, and the FBSDE *nonlinear* Feynman-Kac formulae?

% - CONSISTENT NOTATION --- there is something weird with functions $f$ and $g$ at the moment, for example\dots

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show convergence of $(u^{(k)},z^{(k)})$ to the true solution $(u^{(*)},z^{(*)})$
    \item Extend our model to multiple dimensions in space 
    \item Implement/find/come up with better numerical methods: e.g. Strong stability Preserving (SSP) methods, Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC), and maybe parallelize the Monte Carlo code (each "point" (t,x,v) could be run in parallel?) GPU or FPGA
\end{itemize}
